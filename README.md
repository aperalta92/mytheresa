## Mytheresa Code Challenge
This is mytheresa's code challenge which is a REST API endpoint where you can request a list of products filtered by a criteria.

## Initialization
I'll assume you already have docker and docker-compose installed on the OS you're using.

The project will be fully initialized by running the bash script "mytheresa.sh".

You can run the script as follows:
> bash mytheresa.sh

## Testing
There are some unit tests implemented for some classes of projects.

You can run the unit tests by running the test.sh script as follows:
> bash test.sh

## REST API request
There is an apache webserver in the docker application, it is ready to receive requests from the url http://www.dev-mytheresa.com, so we need to modify the hosts file of our system to be able to add the requests to the following line

You can find the hosts file in different paths depending on the OS you're using:

Windows: C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts

Linux: /etc/hosts

Mac: /private/etc/hosts

> 127.0.0.1 www.dev-mytheresa.com dev-mytheresa.com

With this added line, you can go to a browser or use an app like [postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) to make the requests

You can make a request like http://www.dev-mytheresa.com/api/products?category=boots&priceLessThan=750

This should return a json response with a filtered list of products in the "boots" category and with a price less than 750â‚¬
